# React

Building an Interface

> > Author Notes:

Create React App is a CLI or Command Line Interface tool created by Facebook, the developers of React to help you set projects up quickly. That means that it's something you'll need to run on a terminal application like Hyper, Gitbash or your Mac's terminal. Before you take this course, make sure you've got a version of npm that's greater than 6 or this won't work.

`npx create-react-app reactinterface`

Speak while installing: This sets up a new project with a series of utilities like Webpack, which will let you run a live server and a development environment, as well as Babel that can let you manage your code and make it write a version that's more compatible with older browsers.

Once the installation is finished, you should see a screen like this that gives you some commands you can run. The most useful commands are npm start, which runs a live server, and also npm run build, which processes your code so that it can load in a server.
